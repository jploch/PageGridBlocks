# PAGEGRID Blocks
This module installs templates and fields for PAGEGRID blocks. PAGEGRID is a friendly pagebuilder for ProcessWire.

When you install a block module, all necessary files will be copied to your "site/template/blocks/" folder automatically (the blocks folder will be created if not already present).

Make sure you don't have any files with the name prefix "pg_" in this folder, as they might get overwritten.

To use this module you need to [buy a copy of PAGEGRID](https://page-grid.com/buy-now/).

- Process Wire 3.0.100 or greater
- PAGEGRID Fieldtype Module
